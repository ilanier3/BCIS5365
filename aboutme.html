				<h2>Hello!</h2>
				<p> Hi, I'm Issac Wilcher 

As you may be wondering why am I here, I will tell you.<br><br> 

I am a current graduate student at Tarleton State University studying Information Systems. It is really a wonder that I'm still studying, but as many would say: knowledge is power. I love learning and if I'm able to learn more about something I'm interested in, then why shouldn't I hop on that? <br><br>

I am also a new Austinite, I moved here in September 2014 for a job working at Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) as a Systems Analyst. It is really a joy working at TAHC. It is a small state agency where you get to know nearly everyone you work with. We have seven offices scattered across Texas, so I get to meet, or rather talk with many different people from all types of backgrounds. <br><br>

My job as I'd describe to a three year older: I help keep the computers of the men and women that keep our horses and cows safe, safe. <br><br>

Outside of work I enjoy hiking, biking, photography, roadtrips, and discovering the many restaurants and food trucks Austin has to offer. <br><br>
